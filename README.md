1) [[**non**]]  LINK: http://non.tuxfamily.org/    and 2) [[**Pure Data**]] (Pd).  LINK: https://puredata.info/  3) [[**Jack**]] LINK: http://www.jackaudio.org/
    - check out this example of what Pure Data can do:  https://guitarextended.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/real-time-guitar-effects-with-raspberry-pi-pd-and-arduino/
- Follow this tutorial and play wav from pi with sufficiently low latency: https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/gpio-music-box/worksheet/
    + follow up on previous point: further develop python script to accept "velocity" input to change the sound depending on hard or soft hits

TOPICS:
- music sources
    - synthesized through credit card sized computers

TODO:
- Follow this tutorial and play wav from pi with sufficiently low latency: https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/gpio-music-box/worksheet/
    + follow up on previous point: further develop python script to accept "velocity" input to change the sound depending on hard or soft hits
